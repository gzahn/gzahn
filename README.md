I'm Geoff Zahn, Assistant Professor of Genomic Data Science at [William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/as/appliedscience/).

## About Me

I lead the [TIDAL Lab](https://gzahn.github.io) (Translational Insights into microbial Diversity, Assembly, & Linkages), where we focus on translational microbial ecology, utilizing microbiomes to enhance plant and ecosystem resilience. Our research encompasses:

- **Microbial Ecology**: Understanding microbial dispersal, assembly, and how they interact within ecosystems.
- **Symbiosis**: Exploring mutually beneficial relationships between hosts and their microbiomes.
- **Conservation**: Applying microbial insights to conserve and restore vital ecosystems.
- **Global Change**: Deciphering the roles of microbes in global biogeochemical cycles.
